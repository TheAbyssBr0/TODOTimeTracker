# TODOTimeTracker
A to-do list and tracker for time spent per task

This will be a remake of an older project: [Project Jasmine](https://github.com/TheAbyssBr0/ProjectJasmine)

It was written in Python with Flask for the REST server and ncurses for the frontend which isn't the best for running on Windows machines.

The remake is planned feature a vanilla JS frontend running in a web browser. The backend will still be a RESTful http server but it will be written in
Java using the Spring framework running in a docker container.
